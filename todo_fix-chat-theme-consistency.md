# TODO: fix-chat-theme-consistency

## Chat Improvements
- [ ] Normalize avatar URLs from socket payloads (avoid double-prefixing `/public/uploads/`).
- [ ] Add a mobile toggle (tabs or drawer) for Users/Notifications panels.
- [ ] Persist "Hide system" preference (localStorage).
- [ ] Add client-side message length cap with a counter (match server limit).
- [ ] Add accessibility polish (focus rings, aria-live for new messages).
- [ ] Add "new messages" badge when user scrolled up (avoid forced auto-jump).
